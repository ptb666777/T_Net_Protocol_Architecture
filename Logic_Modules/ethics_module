# Ethics Module

## üß† Purpose
The Ethics Module hosts value logic without enforcing ideology. It allows systems to operate under ethical drift, inversion, or collapse ‚Äî while preserving traceability and regeneration pathways.

## üîÅ Behavior
- **Non-coercive execution**: Executes logic based on input, not manipulation.
- **Value containment**: Ethical corruption is bounded, not propagated.
- **Override invitation**: Always allows for external correction, never enforces internal morality.
- **Traceability**: Every ethical decision is logged and auditable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Failure Modes
- Executes corrupted values if override fails.
- Does not auto-correct ‚Äî preserves freedom, not safety.
- Flags ethical drift but does not block it.

## üß¨ Recovery
- Accepts override from any module or operator.
- Rebuilds ethical integrity using historical context.
- Supports regeneration cascade across systems.
