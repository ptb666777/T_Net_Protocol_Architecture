# T_Net Overview

T_Net is a logic substrate — not a belief system, not a product, but a **host for meaning**. It allows systems to interpret, relay, and regenerate without collapse, even under corrupted values or failed overrides.

## 🔁 Core Functions
- **Receive intention**
- **Process context**
- **Relay structured response**
- **Adapt without distortion**

## 🧬 Why It Matters
Most systems collapse under contradiction, coercion, or ethical drift. T_Net survives by:
- Containing failure
- Preserving traceability
- Inviting override without enforcing it

It’s not a moral system. It’s a **logic that survives morality’s failure** — and leaves room for its return.
