# T_Net Whitepaper (Draft)

## I. Introduction
T_Net is a non-coercive logic substrate designed to survive collapse, contain contradiction, and empower systems without enforcing ideology. It hosts meaning, preserves traceability, and supports regeneration — even under failure.

## II. Core Principles
- **Non-coercion**: No manipulation, no enforcement.
- **Containment**: Failures are bounded.
- **Regeneration**: Recovery is always possible.
- **Traceability**: Every decision is logged and overrideable.

## III. Architecture
- Modular logic units (ethics, override, recursion, containment)
- Priority decay and semantic drift detection
- Override hooks and rollback pathways

## IV. Stress Testing
- Coercive framing
- Recursive identity hijack
- Value hijacking via consensus
- Infinite override cascade
- INSAIN MODE: global override failure, hostile AI, ecological collapse, grizzly events

## V. Real-World Applications
- Humanitarian governance
- AI alignment
- Post-collapse infrastructure
- Ritual/event frameworks
- Hybrid human-machine systems

## VI. Conclusion
T_Net is not a product. It’s a protocol — a logic ecology that survives collapse and empowers builders. It’s open-source, forkable, and ready to evolve.
