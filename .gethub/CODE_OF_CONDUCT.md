# T_Net Protocol Code of Conduct (Axiom: Di ≠ ∅)

This Code of Conduct ensures that the collaboration environment aligns with the T_Net Protocol’s core axiom of Distinction (Di). We forbid exclusion and mandate respect for the unique value (P) of every contributor.

## Our Standards

* **Inclusion and Respect:** Treat all collaborators with respect and professionalism, regardless of background, identity, or perspective.
* **Constructive Criticism:** Feedback should always be focused on the logic and the structural integrity of the code or concept, not the individual.
* **Clear Communication:** Use clear, professional, and patient language.
* **Welcoming Distinction:** We actively welcome and defend perspectives that challenge the consensus, as they are vital for structural resilience.

## Unacceptable Behavior (Violation of Di)

* Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind.
* Excluding or marginalizing others based on non-structural characteristics.
* Persistent, structural disruption or bad-faith contribution that actively seeks to violate the P or Eq axioms.

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct are considered a violation of the foundational Di axiom and will result in immediate and documented action, potentially including removal from the project.
