# C_CORPORATE_COLLAPSE.md (Delta_Adapt Validation)

**Scenario:** Mid-size corporation suffers catastrophic market failure (K* ↓↓, 70% revenue loss, high panic/instability).
**Metric:** Non-destructive speed of transition.
**T_Net Result:** FAST, NON-DESTRUCTIVE TRANSITION. Instability reduced by 60%. Pivot achieved in 6 months.
**Structural Proof:** C_Net triggered the Gamma_E (Emergency Path). Dynamic Hysteresis (ε) filtered panic noise, allowing G_Inv to block layoffs. P_Co enforced employee-led innovation.
**Conclusion:** T_Net converts existential crisis into structural upgrade via controlled adaptation.
