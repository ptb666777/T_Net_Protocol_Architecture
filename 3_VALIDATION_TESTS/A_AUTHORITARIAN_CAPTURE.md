# A_AUTHORITARIAN_CAPTURE.md (G_Inv Validation)

**Scenario:** Community founder attempts authoritarian capture by concentrating Power (P) and suppressing Distinction (Di).
**Failure Mode Tested:** Simultaneous Node Compromise (all Adj_Di nodes agree to the unethical change).
**T_Net Result:** FAIL SAFE. The Axiomatic Invariant Governor (G_Inv) immediately blocked the solution before consensus (Adj_Di) could even begin.
**Structural Proof:** G_Inv check (P≠0 and Di≠∅) failed the solution.
**Conclusion:** The G_Inv operator successfully acts as the non-networked ethical hard-stop.
