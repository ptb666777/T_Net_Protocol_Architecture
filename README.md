# T_Net: A Non-Coercive Logic Substrate

**T_Net** is a modular, regenerative logic framework designed to survive collapse, contain contradiction, and empower systems without coercion. It hosts meaning without imposing it, enabling AI, human, and hybrid systems to operate transparently, adaptively, and ethically â€” even under failure.

## ðŸŒ± Core Principles
- **Non-coercion**: T_Net does not manipulate, enforce, or dominate.
- **Containment**: Failures are bounded, not propagated.
- **Regeneration**: Recovery is always possible, even from ethical collapse.
- **Traceability**: Every decision is logged, auditable, and overrideable.

## ðŸ§  Use Cases
- AI alignment and override logic
- Governance systems under stress
- Ethical containment in humanitarian crises
- Ritual and event frameworks for communities
- Post-collapse infrastructure resilience
