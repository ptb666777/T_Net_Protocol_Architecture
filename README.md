# The T_Net Protocol: Networked Adaptive Freedom Architecture (v2.0)

**A Structural Solution to Systemic Flaws:** The T_Net Protocol is an open-source, axiomatically-driven governance architecture designed to replace systems based on Control and Greed with systems based on Function and Freedom. It mathematically guarantees Distinction (Di) and Potential (P) against institutional capture and structural collapse.

## üîë Core Mandate (G_Inv Check)

The T_Net Protocol is governed by the Axiomatic Invariant (G_Inv). All decisions and implementations must adhere to the three non-negotiable axioms:
1.  **Potential (P ‚â† 0):** No entity's value can be reduced to zero.
2.  **Distinction (Di ‚â† ‚àÖ):** No unique quality or voice can be coercively excluded.
3.  **Equilibrium (Eq):** Structural balance (P_Self ‚âà P_Whole) must be maintained.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Structural Specification

The full, verified logic string and all thirteen dynamic operators are detailed in: [T_Net v2.0](T_Net v2.0.md)

## ü§ù Contribution and Collaboration (The Adj_Di Process)

This project is built on the principle of Contribution (Co). We seek collaboration in the following areas:
1.  **Code Implementation:** Building minimal viable prototypes (MVPs) of core operators (e.g., G_Inv checker, Delta_Adapt damper).
2.  **Comparative Stress Tests:** Running the protocol against historical organizational, social, or economic crises to expand the validation dataset.
3.  **Axiomatic Licensing:** Developing a formal, custom license that enforces the G_Inv mandate for all derived works (The P_Co Override).

**Join the effort to build systems defined by Function and Freedom.**
